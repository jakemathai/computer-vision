This is a collection of example python command line scripts that interact with the google vision api. The objective was to create a few simple python scripts that are to follow along with in a python shell or notebook. I was working along at this website : https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-landmarks

The landmark.py script detects landmarks (eg: Mt Everest, Guggenheim) in a image served up at a url.



 Prerequisites /Setup your environment:
  1)Setup a Google cloud account so you can access the machine learning libraries
  2)I used a google compute linux instance, load Python 2.7, install pip, (install google python libraries) pip install --upgrade google-cloud-vision, 
  Goto the Google cloud management console and create a service account and generate a key. Download the key .json file to a directory on workstation 
  Define/export an environment variable "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='path to your JSON service account file' so you can get authorized access to the API.
