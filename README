This is a collection of example python command line scripts that interact with the Google vision api. The objective is to create a simple command line python script that interacts with google's  machine learning vision api. This is a good link and primer/background. : https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-landmarks

1)The landmark.py script uses google's vision api to detect landmarks (eg: Mt Everest, Guggenheim) in a image served up at a url.
2)The label_detect.py script uses google's visionapi to detect labels (eg: cat, dog, mountains) in your image.
3)The text_detect.py script detects OCR/text within an image.


 Prerequisites /Setup your environment:
  1)Setup a Google cloud account so you can access the machine learning libraries
  2)I used a google compute linux instance, load Python 2.7, install pip, install google python libraries (pip install --upgrade google-cloud-vision) 
  Goto the Google cloud management console and create a service account and generate a key. Download the key (.json) file to a directory on workstation 
  Define/export an environment variable "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='path to your JSON service account file' so you can get authorized access to the API.
